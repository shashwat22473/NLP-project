# NLP-project
This is the project for my NLP course. The project is about the Gender abuse detection in Indic language.
To run the baseline model code we just need to change the path of the dataset according to your system  and the code should run fine.


Currently the baseline model gives an F1 score of:
  1) English = 50%
  2) Hindi = 50%
  3) Tamil = 37%
